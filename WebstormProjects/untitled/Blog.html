        <h2 class="blogHeadline">Jon Snow</h2>

        <p>Though presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark,
            Jon is the son of Lady Lyanna Stark, Eddard's sister,
            with Rhaegar Targaryen. From infancy, Jon is raised by
            Eddard as his own alongside his lawful children at Winterfell
            and Jon's true parentage is kept secret. In order to
            escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch
            and is chosen as Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's personal
            steward, and wields the House Mormont ancestral Valyrian
            steel sword, Longclaw, a gift from Mormont, who came to see Jon as a surrogate son. </p>
